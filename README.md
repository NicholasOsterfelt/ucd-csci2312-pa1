_working with objects_

* * *

Point object:
  The point class, defined and implemented in Point.h and Point.cpp, is used to create 3D Point objects, that contain member variables for x, y, and z coordinates. Points contain accessor and mutator methods to allow access to private member variables, and change private member variables. There is also a distanceTo function that calculates the distance to the specified point passed as an argument.

pa1.cpp:
  pa1.cpp implements the "getArea" function used to calculate the area from a triangle subsequently created by having three point objects. It asks the user to enter the coordinates of the 3 points and then ouputs the area of the triangle created.
